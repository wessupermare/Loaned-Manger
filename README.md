Hello SBJA Soundwaves, et al! This website will always contain the most recent music and audio for your enjoyment. If you notice any problems, feel free to file an "Issue".

The folders work as follows:
  !Wav - All of the rendered audio so that you can practice without a full band.
  Song Number-Song Name - Sheet music and Sibelius files, as well as more copies of the relevent audio.
  .gitattributes - Ignore this, its only purpose is to allow me to update the music as necessary.

Please enjoy, and I look forward to playing with you all on the day!
