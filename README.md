Hello SBJA Soundwaves, et al! This website will always contain the most recent music and audio for your enjoyment. If you notice any problems, feel free to file an "Issue".<br/><br/>

The folders work as follows:<br/>
  !Wav - All of the rendered audio so that you can practice without a full band.<br/>
  Song Number-Song Name - Sheet music and Sibelius files, as well as more copies of the relevent audio.<br/>
  .gitattributes - Ignore this, its only purpose is to allow me to update the music as necessary.<br/><br/>

Please enjoy, and I look forward to playing with you all on the day!
